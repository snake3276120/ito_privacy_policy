# Idle Tower Offender

## Introduction

Greetings, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I understand that it is quite lengthy, so if you are solely interested in obtaining the game, feel free to skip ahead and go to [this](#the-game) section.

While this game is indeed complete, I must admit that it is kinda boring. As the developer behind this project, I make this statement because it is essentially a side project. My motivation and objective lie in traversing the entire path of game development, starting from scratch and concluding with its release. Therefore, for us, it represents more of a "from 0 to 1" experience rather than a pursuit of immediate financial success.

I have decided to partially open-source the project, specifically the game code and data objects. However, assets, scenes, prefabs, and similar elements will not be included. Additionally, I aim to share the insights and lessons I have gained throughout this process. My hope is that these resources can provide assistance not only for your own projects but also for your professional growth and aspirations.

### About Myself

I am currently located in the Greater Toronto Area, specifically Markham, Ontario, Canada. In 2013, I graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.

I am employed full time as a lead level software engineer at a multinational corporation listed on the NYSE. While it may not be considered a FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) or similar top-tier company, it holds a prominent position in the industry. Prior to my current role, I have worked as a software developer in various domains. Additionally, I have a background of three years as an IC Test Engineer, which aligns with my educational background, albeit not as personally fulfilling.

Throughout my life, I have been an avid gamer, starting from the tender age of five. However, with the arrival of my first child in 2021, my gaming activities have been greatly reduced, although I still manage to find time to play video games, almost on a daily basis, but with much less time.

To summarize, I am a seasoned software developer with professional experience in diverse industries, however, excluding the game industry. In the mean time, I maintain a passionate interest in gaming, which has been an inseparable part of my life since childhood.

### Motivations

I always wanted to design and create my own game, as well as making it my own business. I know this is hard and this is almost impossible. I tried to start many projects or joined other's projects before this one, but they all failed.

By no means I'm comparing my game to Rimworld, but when I see Tynan Sylvester started his campaign on Kickstarter (I am the among the very early adopters of Rimworld). He not only designed the game but also wrote the code and created certain assets. Subsequently, he outsourced other assets and music (presumably to the same individual who contributed to the music in Prison Architect). Witnessing the achievements of a single individual in creating something remarkable deeply inspired me. Although I acknowledge that I am far from reaching his level, I am determined to embark on this journey. After all, every significant undertaking requires taking the first step, and for me, this project represents a monumental leap forward. While the game may currently appear simple and lacking excitement, it holds the distinction of being a complete and meticulously bug-free experience.

Created a few tech prototypes, 论证了可行性，然后就开始了。技术上来说确实，但我们走了其他很多弯路，后面会详细说。
