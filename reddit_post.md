# Idle Tower Offender

## Introduction

Hi everyone, thank you for reading my post. It's going to be a long post, so if you just want to get the game you can jump to this section.

This is a complete game, but also a boring one. I say this as the dev of this game, because this is purely a side project. My motivation and goal is to basically walk the full path of game development, from scratch to release. So for us, it is more of a "from 0 to 1" experience, than "we want the game to earn our first bucket of gold".

I decide to partially open source the project (game code and data objects only, no assets/scenes, etc.) and share my experience and takeaways. Hopefully it can help you with your project or even your career.

### About Myself

I'm physically located in the Greater Toronto Area (or to be precise, Markham), Ontario, Canada. I graduated form University of Toronto in 2013 with a bachelor degree of Electrical Engineering. Currently I work as a full time software engineer (lead level) in a 2nd tier (non FAANG or whatever you call those companies) NYSE listed multi national big corp. Before that, I basically worked as a software dev in multiple domains, and spent 3 years as an IC Test Engineer which fits my degree but I find it boring.

I'm a heavy gamer since I was 5, until I had my first kid in 2021. I still play video games on a daily basis but just with much less time.

So, in summary, I'm a professional software developer who never worked in the game industry, and I am a heavy gamer.

### Motivations

I always wanted to design and create my own game, as well as making it my own business. I know this is hard and this is almost impossible. I tried to start many projects or joined other's projects before this one, but they all failed.

However, you have to take a first step anyways, and this project is a huge step for me. Yea the game is simple and boring but at least it's a complete game, and should be bug free.

### About the "Team"
